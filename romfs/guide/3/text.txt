There are mutliple different ways to create a save file backup.
 
The first one creates a backup for the selected user. For this select the game you want to backup 
the save files for in the EdiZon main menu and select the user the save belongs to. In the newly 
opened interface, press the (X) button to create a backup. The keyboard will pop up where you can 
enter a custom name for the backup folder. By default the current date and time will be used. 
Afterwards you'll have the choice to upload the save file to anonfile.com in which case you'll 
receive a console-unique key that can be entered on https://edizon.werwolv.net to access all files. 
The save file will get stored in /switch/EdiZon/saves/<titleID> in both cases. 
 
The second option will create a backup containing all save files of all users for one specific 
game. To do this hover over a game's icon in EdiZon's main menu and press the (X) button. 
The keyboard will pop up asking you for a name for the backup. After entering the save files 
will get copied to /switch/EdiZon/batch. 
 
The last option is called a batch backup. It will create a backup of all save files on the system. 
This can be done by holding down the (ZR) button while pressing the (X) button in the EdiZon 
main menu. A warning will pop up and after accepting, the save files will be copied into 
/switch/EdiZon/batch.
