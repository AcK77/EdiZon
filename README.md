# Save editor Config and Script files

  To download working Editor Config and Editor Script files, visit [this repository](https://github.com/WerWolv/EdiZon_ConfigsAndScripts/tree/master)

  Check out our [Wiki page](https://github.com/WerWolv/EdiZon/wiki) for more information on how to build your own Editor Config and Editor Script files.

# How to install

  1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/WerWolv/EdiZon/releases/latest).
  2. Unpack the downloaded zip file, put the files on your Nintendo Switch's SD card and let the folders merge.
  3. Use a free open source CFW like [Atmosph√®re](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) to launch the hbmenu and start EdiZon from there.

# How to compile

  1. Download and install devkitA64. It comes bundled with the [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org) toolchain.
  2. Required libraries are libNX, libcurl, zlib and freetype2. Use the pacman package manager that comes with devkitPro to download and install libNX, portlibs (`switch-portlibs`) and freetype2 (`switch-freetype`). 
  3. The rest of the compilation works using the `make` command. Type `make homebrew` to build EdiZon, `make sysmodule` to build the companion sysmodule used for RAM editing or `make all` to build both.
